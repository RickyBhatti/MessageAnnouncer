# Message Announcer

A simple automatic chat announcement script designed for FiveM servers.  

This script was designed to be server-sided rather than client-sided. That way, all clients will see the same message after *X* minutes, rather than every client seeing different messages.

## Features
- Prefix and suffix support. (Prefix is required, while suffix is not.)
- Unlimited announcements.
- Supports announcement colors and formatting. 
- Server-sided, so all clients are synced.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release.
2. Drag MessageAnnouncer into your resource folder.
3. Go to your server.cfg, and write "start MessageAnnouncer"

That's it! If everything went correctly, next time you start your server you'll see a message along the lines of "MessageAnnouncer | Successfully started." indicating everything went smoothly.
